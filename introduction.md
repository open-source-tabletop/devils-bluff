# Devil's Bluff

Devil's Bluff is a Wild West Skirmish Game set in the town of Solitude, a mysterious frontier town full of the forgotten and lost.

## A Quick Death

Wooden shutters rattle and doors creak on the faded and worn timber buildings, a harsh wind whips up a dust devil that dances in the nearly empty main street, and the sun hangs in the sky, burnt red, swollen, and angry. Wary eyes peak from the cracks in windows and doors, fixed squarely on the two men, as they eye each other from twenty paces, their wide brimmed hats pulled down to shield their eyes, their hands poised ready to reach for glinting iron.

Breath is held. 

Eyes fixed.

Suddenly a hand moves, a sound like a cracking whip, and silence. One of the men crumples and falls, shot through. The other returns his gun smoothly to his hip and straightens his hat. Without a word he continues on his way, heading into town, to see what this place has to offer for the weary traveller.

## Solitude

Many find themselves stumbling into town of Solitude, half dead, weary from long travels from who can say where, forgotten roads leading to a forgotten town. But there's no peace to be found here, no rest for the wicked, as each find themselves drawn into conflict. Sure some might think they come with ideals and grand notions but when everything is settled at the end of a gun there's no one can be called a hero.

Solitude is a sprawling frontier town, surrounded by vast deserts and impenetrable mountains, and dranched in the glow of a dim red sun that never seems to set. The rule of law has long since fled this place, replaced by endless conflict as the strong gather the weak to their ends and wage a petty war. And to what end?

## An Old Tale

Some say there's only one way to leave solitude, and that's at the end of a barrel. But there are those who feel they have done this before, haunted by a grim sense that they are locked into an endless cycle of violence. There are other stories though. There are stories of a man dressed all in blacl, hooded eyes hidden beneath his wide hat. Some say he comes only for the most wicked and delivers justice to them, while others say he comes only for those who sacrifice for a greater good, bringing aid in their time of need.

## Newcomer

Every once in a while someone arrives in Solitude, not worn, or weary, but willful. These individuals quickly gain a following, those eager to gain power or protection, willing to fight and die for any cause. These events usually result in escalation of hostilities as rival gangs quickly get shaken up, the weak die and the strong join forces, before long the streets of Solitude are as red as the hateful sun. Once that starts only all out victory or death can set things right.

So what are you? Weak or willful?

Are you here to make the town a 'safe place' with your law or to take everything it has to offer?

Round up a posse and make your mark on Solitude.
