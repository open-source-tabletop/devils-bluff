# Campaigns

In addition to playing Devil's Bluff in one-off games you can play through a number of games in a connected campaign, charting the rise and fall of each as their fortunes come and go. In a campaign you will track the experience and skills of your fighters as they improve or suffer injuries, manage the running costs of your gang to ensure you have enough to pay your fighters after each battle, and track your growing power and influence in the town of Solitude.

## Gangs

### Gang Roster

In order to manage your gang you will need to create a gange roster and this can be done simply on a piece of paper or digitally. You will need to track 3 main things:

- Your gang's **Power**, this is their standing and influence within Solitude.
- Your gang's finances, you will need to earn money to keep paying for your fighters.
- The experience, skills learned, and injuries sustained by each of your fighters.

### Starting Gangs

In a campaign, there are some changes to how gangs are created, starting off much smaller and building in strength over time. Each gang in a campaign has 300 dollars to spend on starting models but may not include any legends. It is important that you can distinguish each member of your gang as they will each have a chance to become more skilled or to suffer injuries throughout the campaign.

### Power

In a campaign, your gang's Power is a number that reflects your gang's position within the city. A higher Power means your gang has control of more territory, is respected and feared by more residents, but also a bigger target for those that would take your position. Each gang starts at level 0 and has a chance to increase their Power after a number of games - dependent on how long a campaign you wish to run.

### Finances

Running a gang doesn't come cheap and fighters expect to be paid for risking their lives. After creating your gang any unspent Dollars are not lost and instead go into your gang's fund. At the end of each game you play you will earn additional income and then must pay each of your fighters from your funds. If you have funds remaining you may have a chance to recruit additional fighters or buy additional equipment. If you have insufficient funds then fighters may leave your gang, and may cause problems for you as they do.

### Experience

After each game you play each of your fighters that survive the battle gain 1 point of experience. Models that are removed as casualties may gain experience as explained below under **Injuries**. Experience should be noted on your gang roster for each of your models.

### Injuries

During a game many of your fighters may be taken off the board as casualties, however this does not always indicate that they have died. A fighter may simply be injured, stunned, or driven off, and has a chance to continue fighting for your gang. After a battle ends, while each player still has cards in their hand, each must make a Defence Draw for each of the fighters in their gang that were removed as casualties. Any cards not in a players hand are first discarded then the deck is shuffled. Players then alternate making their Defence Draws starting with the player that lost the battle.

Any model that fails this draw makes another draw immediately and consults the injury chart below, if a model gains an injury they already have then the draw is treated as **Lucky**:

| Draw | Injury | Outcome |
| :--- | :----- | :------ |
| 1-2  | Leg Wound | This model only moves 2" when making an Advance action and does not gain any experience for this battle. |
| 3-4  | Arm Wound | This model now suffers -2 to Attack Draws against enemies within 3 inches and does not gain any experience for this battle. |
| 5-6  | Impaired Vision | This model can no longer target models more than 9 inches away and does not gain any experience for this battle. |
| 7-9  | Hardened | This model gains a Toughness of 4 but may not fight in the next battle and does not gain any experience for this battle. |
| 10-12| Lucky | The fighter survives but does not gain any experience for this battle. |
| 13   | True Grit | This model recovers without further injury abd gains experience as normal. |
