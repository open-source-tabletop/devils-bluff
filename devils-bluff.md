There are no men here, only monsters.

# Playing Devil's Bluff

Devil's Bluff uses the [Cadence Core Rules](https://cadence.games) with the additional rules listed below. This game requires a battlefield around 2ft by 3ft, or something with a similar area, and plenty of terrain to fill it. Each game lasts for 5 rounds.

## The Deck

Instead of six sided dice, Devils Bluff uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards, with Jokers removed, to determine success and failure of actions. All 'rolls' in the core rules are referred to as 'draws' in this game. At the start of the game, shuffle a deck of cards and place it in reach of all players, this is The Deck. Any time an action would require you to roll a dice the player instead draws a card and then reveals it to the other player, taking the value of the card as their "roll". Cards are numbered according to their value regardless of suit with the Jack, Queen, and King having a value of 11, 12, and 13 respectively.

If a player is required to draw a certain value but fails to do so, they have an additional chance for success if they can play a set or a sequence of cards that add up to an amount that is required for success, that can count as a single success. A set of cards is 3 or 4 cards of the same value. A sequence is combination of 3 or 4 cards that have consecutive values and alternate from black and red suits (such as the 3 of hearts, 4 of clubs, and 5 of diamonds).

## The Hand

At the start of the game, after shuffling the deck, each player draws 3 cards, keeping their faces hidden from the other players. Any time a player draws a card, they may instead swap it with one in their hand. In this way players have partial control of the action in the game.

## Horses

A model that is mounted on a horse gains a number of benefits detailed below. A model on a horse may dismount at the start of any activation, removing these benefits, but may not again mount their horse for the remainder of the game.

A model on a horse has the following changes:

- Increased Movement to 12"
- +1 to their Attack Draws against models at the same or lower height level.
- Mounted models treat climbable terrain as impassable.
- A mounted model does not gain the benefit of the Cover terrain keyword.

### Injuries 

When a model loses its last hit point, instead of being removed from the game they take an Injury Test. Draw a card for the model:

- If you draw an Ace the model is incapacitated and removed from the game.
- If you draw a 2-10 the model survives but is injured, and should be marked as such, returning its Hit Points to 1. This model loses any remaining Command Points it has. If the model should lose its last hit point again it is automatically incapacitated and removed from the game.
- If you draw a 11+ the model survives unscathed, remaining at 1 Hit Point as though it did not lose its final hit point.

### Attack Rolls

Attack roll modifiers have the following changes for drawing cards, for quick reference these are double their original value:

- **Close Range Penalty**: Attack Rolls against a target unit within 3 inches of your model only hit on a **draw of 12+**, instead of using the attacking model's Skill attribute. However, weapons with the **Assault** special rule don't suffer this penalty.
- **Rush Penalty**: Units performing 3 or more actions this activation suffer a **-4 modifier** to their Attack Rolls.
- **Height Advantage**: Gain a **+2 modifier** to your Attack Roll when attacking a model at a lower height level (see the terrain rules).
- **Obscured Penalty**: When attacking a target with an obscured line of sight, suffer a **-2 modifier** to your Attack Roll.

### Counter Rolls

Counter rolls have the following modified values for drawing cards:

| Weapon Damage vs target Toughness            | Counter Draw |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----------: |
| Damage is half, or lower, than Toughness     | 4+           |
| Damage is lower than Toughness               | 6+           |
| Damage is equal to Toughness                 | 8+           |
| Damage is higher than Toughness              | 11+          |
| Damage is double, or higher, than Toughness  | 13           |

### Routing

Any gang that has lost 50% of its models or has lost its leader becomes increasingly likely to flee the fight. If your gang has met these conditions you must draw a card every time you activate a unit and place it face up where your oppponent can see it. This is not in the discard pile and each player keeps their own cards if they have both met the conditions. Once this pile has reached a total greater than 21 your gang has routed, after the current activation your gang will flee and the game ends.

### Special Rules

### Stake A Claim

In the chaos of the earthquake lots of sites were abandoned, leaving valuable resources to be claimed by the first group able to backup that claim with sufficient force.

#### Setup

After setting up the terrain, both players draw a card then, starting with the winner, players alternate placing 6 **Recovery Objectives** around thr battlefield. These must be at least 6 inches from the table edges and from any other objective marker. Players draw again, with the winner choosing one of the table edges, the other player takes the opposing table edge. Each player may place an entry point anywhere on their table edge.

#### Objectives

Each model that secures one of the recover objectives can score it by surviving to the end of the battle or by moving to touch their entry point. Each objective is worth 3 Victory Points when scored.





### Run Them Out Of Town

Two gangs have taken up residence in town, a little too close for comfort, and this town is only big enough for one.

#### Setup

After setting up the terrain a single **control objective** is placed in the centre of the table. Players draw, with the winner choosing one of the table edges, the other player takes the opposing table edge. Each player may place an entry point anywhere on their table edge.

#### Objectives

The control objective is worth a number of Victory Points equal to the round number.





### High Noon

Tensions have never been higher in Devils Bluff and rivalries grow until they spill out into the streets in bloody shoot outs.

#### Setup

After setting up the terrain, both players draw a card then the winner chooses one of the table edges, the other player takes the opposite edge. In order, players may then place 2 entry points on their table edge.

#### Objectives

Each enemy model that your gang kills is worth 1 Victory Point each, you still score the additional points for killing Legends or Leaders. Causing your opponent to rout is worth 2 Victory Points.
