# Devils' Bluff

Welcome to the town of Devil's Bluff: a lawless place where anything goes and danger walks hand-in-hand with opportunity. In this fast, deadly skirmish game, you'll put together a gang of gunslingers, battle for dominance, wealth, and power, as you build your Wild West legend.

### A Bad Hand

Nestled amidst the untamed wilds, where the relentless sun beats down on arid terrain and the winds whisper tales of both despair and hope, sat the town of Barton's Bluff. Shielded from the prying eyes of the law and the vigilant watch of the righteous, this once-thriving settlement now harbors shadows of darkness and deceit. Once, Barton's Bluff held the promise of a brighter future. Vast tracts of fertile land and hidden veins of coal beneath the surrounding hills hinted at boundless wealth and prosperity. Yet, the pursuit of fortune and influence exacts a toll.

Unscrupulous land barons, opulent mine operators, and cutthroat magnates fixed their gaze on Barton's Bluff, their avarice casting a long, foreboding shadow. Sensing the encroaching darkness, the local priest orchestrated a gathering within the hallowed confines of the church. Heads of factions and their trusted confidants convened in this unlikely sanctuary, each believing they had an opportunity to further their goals, unaware that destiny had other designs.

As fervent discussions reached a crescendo, the very foundations of the town trembled beneath the weight of their transgressions. The earth itself rebelled, as Barton's Bluff was shaken by an earthquake. Chaos erupted as a portion of the land crumbled, shrouding the town in a pall of dust. As the tremors subsided and people gathered their wits, they beheld a town spared from significant harm, save for the church—crushed beneath the rubble, along with its ill-fated occupants. Had the town been saved, or forsaken? The weary and downtrodden inhabitants began to murmur a new name for their home—Devils Bluff—an emblem of the corruption that had taken root.

### Playing the cards you're dealt

As the new day dawned, a new chapter started in Devils Bluff—one of opportunity and treacherous ambition. The high and mighty had fallen, silenced by the cruel hand of fate. A power vacuum emerged, leaving the workers, the small-time gangs, the hired thugs, and the few righteous souls to vie for control over the remnants of the fractured town. Each faction harbored its own desires—for power, for wealth, for the restoration of law and order, and everyone must choose a side.

# Module Rules

## Playing Devil's Bluff

Devil's Bluff requires a battlefield around 2ft by 3ft, or something with a similar area, and plenty of terrain to fill it. Each game lasts for 5 rounds.

## The Deck

Instead of six sided dice, Devils Bluff uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards, with Jokers removed, to determine success and failure of actions. At the start of the game, shuffle a deck of cards and place it in reach of all players, this is The Deck. Any time an action would require you to roll a dice the player instead draws a card and then reveals it to the other player, taking the value of the card as their "roll". Cards are numbered according to their value regardless of suit with the Jack, Queen, and King having a value of 11, 12, and 13 respectively.

If a player is required to draw a certain value to but fails to do so, they may have an additional chance for success. If the player has a sequence of 2 or 3 cards (i.e. numbers in the same suit in order such as the 2, 3, and 4 of clubs) or they have 2 or 3 of the same value card, and these combined equal the value required, this will count as a single success.

### The Hand

At the start of the game, after shuffling the deck, each player draws 3 cards, keeping their faces hidden from the other players. Any time a player draws a card, they may instead swap it with one in their hand. In this way players can have partial control of the action in the game.

## Cover

It is advised to count all solid terrain, such as walls, rocks, barrels, etc as having the **Cover** keyword while softer terrain such as fences or plants will only obscure line of sight.

## Injuries 

When a model loses its last hit point, instead of being removed from the game they take an Injury Test. Draw a card for the model:

- If you draw an Ace the model is incapacitated and removed from the game.
- If you draw a 2-10 the model survives but is injured, and should be marked as such, returning its Hit Points to 1. This model loses any remaining Command Points it has. If the model should lose its last hit point again it is automatically incapacitated and removed from the game.
- If you draw a 11+ the model survives unscathed, remaining at 1 Hit Point as though it did not lose its final hit point.

## Attack Rolls

Attack roll modifiers have the following changes for drawing cards, for quick reference these are double their original value:

- **Close Range Penalty**: Attack Rolls against a target unit within 3 inches of your model only hit on a **draw of 12+**, instead of using the attacking model's Skill attribute. However, weapons with the **Assault** special rule don't suffer this penalty.
- **Rush Penalty**: Units performing 3 or more actions this activation suffer a **-4 modifier** to their Attack Rolls.
- **Height Advantage**: Gain a **+2 modifier** to your Attack Roll when attacking a model at a lower height level (see the terrain rules).
- **Obscured Penalty**: When attacking a target with an obscured line of sight, suffer a **-2 modifier** to your Attack Roll.

## Counter Rolls

Counter rolls have the following modified values for drawing cards:

| Weapon Damage vs target Toughness            | Counter Draw |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----------: |
| Damage is half, or lower, than Toughness     | 4+           |
| Damage is lower than Toughness               | 6+           |
| Damage is equal to Toughness                 | 8+           |
| Damage is higher than Toughness              | 11+          |
| Damage is double, or higher, than Toughness  | 13           |
