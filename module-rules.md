# Devil's Bluff Rules

---

Devil's Bluff uses the [Cadence Core Rules](../core-rules/introduction.md) with the additional rules listed below. This game requires a battlefield around 2ft by 3ft, or something with a similar area, and plenty of terrain to fill it. Each game lasts for 5 rounds.

## The Deck

Instead of six sided dice, Devils Bluff uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards, with Jokers removed, to determine success and failure of actions. All 'rolls' in the core rules are referred to as 'draws' in this game. At the start of the game, shuffle a deck of cards and place it in reach of all players, this is The Deck. Any time an action would require you to roll a dice the player instead draws a card and then reveals it to the other player, taking the value of the card as their "roll". Cards are numbered according to their value regardless of suit with the Jack, Queen, and King having a value of 11, 12, and 13 respectively.

If a player is required to draw a certain value but fails to do so, they have an additional chance for success if they can play a set or a sequence of cards that add up to an amount that is required for success, that can count as a single success. A set of cards is 3 or 4 cards of the same value. A sequence is combination of 3 or 4 cards that have consecutive values and alternate from black and red suits (such as the 3 of hearts, 4 of clubs, and 5 of diamonds).

## The Hand

At the start of the game, after shuffling the deck, each player draws 3 cards, keeping their faces hidden from the other players. Any time a player draws a card, they may instead swap it with one in their hand. In this way players have partial control of the action in the game.

## Horses

A model that is mounted on a horse gains a number of benefits detailed below. A model on a horse may dismount at the start of any activation, removing these benefits, but may not again mount their horse for the remainder of the game.

A model on a horse has the following changes:

- Increased Movement to 12"
- +1 to their Attack Draws against models at the same or lower height level.
- Mounted models treat climbable terrain as impassable.
- A mounted model does not gain the benefit of the Cover terrain keyword.

## Injuries 

When a model loses its last hit point, instead of being removed from the game they take an Injury Test. Draw a card for the model:

- If you draw an Ace the model is incapacitated and removed from the game.
- If you draw a 2-10 the model survives but is injured, and should be marked as such, returning its Hit Points to 1. This model loses any remaining Command Points it has. If the model should lose its last hit point again it is automatically incapacitated and removed from the game.
- If you draw a 11+ the model survives unscathed, remaining at 1 Hit Point as though it did not lose its final hit point.

## Attack Rolls

Attack roll modifiers have the following changes for drawing cards, for quick reference these are double their original value:

- **Close Range Penalty**: Attack Rolls against a target unit within 3 inches of your model only hit on a **draw of 12+**, instead of using the attacking model's Skill attribute. However, weapons with the **Assault** special rule don't suffer this penalty.
- **Rush Penalty**: Units performing 3 or more actions this activation suffer a **-4 modifier** to their Attack Rolls.
- **Height Advantage**: Gain a **+2 modifier** to your Attack Roll when attacking a model at a lower height level (see the terrain rules).
- **Obscured Penalty**: When attacking a target with an obscured line of sight, suffer a **-2 modifier** to your Attack Roll.

## Counter Rolls

Counter rolls have the following modified values for drawing cards:

| Weapon Damage vs target Toughness            | Counter Draw |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----------: |
| Damage is half, or lower, than Toughness     | 4+           |
| Damage is lower than Toughness               | 6+           |
| Damage is equal to Toughness                 | 8+           |
| Damage is higher than Toughness              | 11+          |
| Damage is double, or higher, than Toughness  | 13           |

## Routing

Any gang that has lost 50% of its models or has lost its leader becomes increasingly likely to flee the fight. If your gang has met these conditions you must draw a card every time you activate a unit and place it face up where your oppponent can see it. This is not in the discard pile and each player keeps their own cards if they have both met the conditions. Once this pile has reached a total greater than 21 your gang has routed, after the current activation your gang will flee and the game ends.

## Special Rules

| Special Rule | Effect |
| :----------- | :----- |
| Longshot | This weapon may double it's Range, but it reduces its Attacks to 1. |
| Leader | This model, and friendly models within 6 inches always pass the check when activating with 1 Command Point. |
| Rookie | When making draws with this model, you may not exchange cards with those in your hand. |
