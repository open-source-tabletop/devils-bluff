## Stake A Claim

There are many areas of Solitude which become abandoned, a rival gang may be driven off leaving the area uncontested, or the wild dust storms may so thoroughly wreck the buildings that the denizens seek shelter elsewhere. Whatever the reason it never takes long for word to spread and the spoils go to those that can take it first.

#### Setup

After setting up the terrain both players draw a card then, starting with the winner, players alternate placing 6 **Recovery Objectives** around the battlefield. These must be at least 9 inches from the table edges and 6 inches from any other objective marker. Players draw again, with the winner choosing one of the table edges, the other player takes the opposing table edge. Each player may place an entry point anywhere on their table edge.

#### Objectives

Each model that secures one of the recover objectives can score it by surviving to the end of the battle or by moving to touch their entry point. Each objective is worth 3 Victory Points when scored.

The Defending player must choose one table edge and set up 3 Control Objectives 12 inches from their table edge, and at least 9 inches from any other table edge or objective marker. They then place 3 entry points anywhere on their table edge. The Attacking player then sets up 3 entry points on the opposite table edge to the Defender.

#### Objectives

Each Objective is worth 1 Victory Point to the Defending Player at the end of every round it is secured and 3 to the Attacking player.
